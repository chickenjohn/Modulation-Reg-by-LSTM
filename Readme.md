# Repository for LSTM based modulation classifier.
This is a forked repo from [this repo](https://github.com/zeroXzero/modulation_classif), 
using LSTM to recognize modulation of signals. I migrated it from tflearn to pure tensorflow.

## Pre-request:

* Python 3
* Tensorflow
* RML dataset(Downloadable from [here](https://www.deepsig.io/datasets/))

## Usage

    python rml_lstm_classify_tf.py
